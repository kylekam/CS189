The Navy supports many systems on deployed ships, ranging from weapons to communications systems. These systems are quite specialized, and some are as many as forty years old. After designing and deploying these systems, it is necessary to maintain them and incrementally update or retrofit them. The goal of our project is to integrate augmented reality in systems maintenance in a way that is feasible in the complex environment of a Navy ship.
